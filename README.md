# Team-Einstein
I was testing this ahead of a project, a fail safe too
Well, i got to find out that there is a Thanos in this universe. A thanos 2.0 for that matter.
Its only natural that for every inevitable Thanos, there is always a smarter and persevering ironman.
That's where Team Einstein comes in.
A group of ironmen from the multiverse as you know it, with the sole purpose of defeating thanos.
Bring us Thanos!
