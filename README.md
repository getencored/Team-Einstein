# Team-Einstein
I was testing this ahead of a project, a fail safe too
Well, i got to find out that there is a Thanos in this universe. A thanos 2.0 for that matter.
Its only natural that for every inevitable Thanos, there is always a smarter and persevering ironman.
That's where Team Einstein comes in.
A group of ironmen from the multiverse as you know it, with the sole purpose of defeating thanos.
Bring us Thanos!

Weird as it seems, there's been a nexus event resulting in the branching of the sacred timeline. 
Probably we have a Loki in our midst, or maybe it's Thanos after all.
that would mean he's already gotten the aether; the reality stone. We must protect the Eye of Agamotto.
